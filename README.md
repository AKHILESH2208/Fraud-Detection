# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using different machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression (using NumPy and scikit-learn)

Decision Tree (using scikit-learn)

Neural Network (using TensorFlow and scikit-learn)

## Dataset

The dataset contains transactional data with various features to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions. It includes:

Features: Transaction amount, user behavior metrics, timestamps, etc.

Labels: 0 (Legitimate) and 1 (Fraudulent)

Dataset Link:
```bash

## Model Implementations

1. Logistic Regression (NumPy + scikit-learn)

A simple classification model using logistic regression implemented with NumPy and also using scikit-learn for comparison.

2. Decision Tree (scikit-learn)

A tree-based model to classify transactions based on feature splits.

3. Neural Network (TensorFlow + scikit-learn)

A deep learning-based approach using TensorFlow's Keras API for better fraud detection.

## Installation
Copy and run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas sklearn tensorflow
